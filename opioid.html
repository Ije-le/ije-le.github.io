            <h2>Opioid Crisis in U.S.</h2>
            <p>
                The first opioid crisis hit the U.S. in the 1990s with intensified marketing of prescription
                opioid medication such as OxyContin marketed by Purdue Pharmaceuticals targeted
                toward pain management. Since 1999, more than 500,000 people have died from an
                overdose of opioids, including prescription and illegal opioids, according to the CDC.
            </p>
            <p>
                The CDC describes opioids as "natural, synthetic, or semi-synthetic chemicals that
                interact with opioid receptors on nerve cells in the body and brain, reducing the intensity of
                pain signals and feelings of pain."
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the 90s, there have been three waves of opioid crises, with the most recent beginning
                in 2013 and involving synthetic opioids, such as illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Fatal
                overdoses from synthetic opioids increased drastically following the pandemic, according to State
                Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC). Between 2020 and 2023, the overall
                number of deaths from opioids alone was nearly 130,000, according to data on the CDC
                website.
            </p>
            <p>The majority of addictions to opioids does not stem from hard and illicit drugs such as heroin. Rather, most begin their addiction to opioids in the form of prescriptive opioids legally prescribed for pain</p>
            <p>Three opiods and stimulants are commonly responsible for overdose deaths in the country. Sometimes they are taken alone, other times, in combinattion.</p>
            
            <img src="https://ije-le.github.io/fent.png" alt="Percentages of opioid and stimulant deaths" class="image">
            <p>In 2023, these frequently occurring opioids and stimulants accounted for nearly 74% of overdose deaths.</p>
            <p>They include illegally-made fentanyl, cociane alone and methamphetamine. A combination of illegally made fentanyl and cocaine or methamphetamine are also among the top causes of opioid overdose deaths across the U.S.</p>

             <p>West Virginia recorded the highest opioid overdose deaths per 100,000, and others states
                like Delaware and Kentucky were among the top 10. South Dakota recorded the least
                number of deaths per 100,000 people.</p>
            <p>Of the 2,769 counties receiving funds, they <a href ="https://www.naco.org/resource/osc-nlc-settlement-dollars#:~:text=As%20shown%20in%20Figure%201,12%25%20of%20total%20funds)."> received</a> an average of $3.15 million with some receiving as much as $24 million over 18 years. Notably, in some states, counties receive the majority of the funds (e.g., North Carolina).</p>

            <h2>Long court cases, opioid settlement cash</h2>
            <p>
                In 2019, Attorneys-General across the country filed lawsuits against opioid manufacturers
                who contributed to the crisis. The lawsuit dragged on till 2021 when settlements were
                reached.
            </p>
            <p>
                The initial settlements, finalized in 2021, included agreements with the three largest
                pharmaceutical distributors—McKesson, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen—who
                collectively agreed to pay up to $21 billion over 18 years. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson
                and its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals committed to paying up to $5 billion over a
                period of no more than nine years. Payments under these 2021 agreements have already
                begun.
            </p>
            <p>
                Further settlements were reached in late 2022 and confirmed in early 2023 with pharmacy
                giants CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart, as well as manufacturers Allergan and Teva.
                Under these additional agreements, Teva will pay up to $3.34 billion over 13 years and provide either $1.2 billion worth of its generic version of Narcan (an overdose reversal medication) or $240 million in cash, depending on each state's preference. Allergan has committed to paying up to $2.02 billion over 7 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pharmacy chains have also agreed to substantial payouts: CVS will contribute up to $4.90 billion over 10 years, Walgreens will pay up to $5.52 billion over 15 years, and Walmart will deliver up to $2.74 billion, with all payments to be completed within 6 years.
            </p>

            <p>
                The combined settlements represent one of the largest public health-related legal resolutions in U.S. history, with potential payments totaling approximately $44.5 billion, plus the additional value of Narcan supplies. Officials note that the actual payout amounts will depend on participation levels among state and local governments, with higher participation resulting in greater funding for opioid crisis abatement programs nationwide. 
            </p>
            <p>Funds are being distributed to states across the US since 2022.</p>

            <h2>How are funds being distributed?</h2>
            <p>
                Data from the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SURDORS) shows the distribution of opioid funds across affected states. New York received the highest sum of money between 2022 and 2023.

        <section>
            <p>According to information on the National Association of Counties website, payments are based on a national allocation formula which considers opioid overdose fatalities, prevalence of opioid use disorder and distribution of opioids.</p>
            <p>Funds allocated between state and local governments varies across states and settlement agreements. However, opioid settlement cash is still rolling for the next decade. </p>
