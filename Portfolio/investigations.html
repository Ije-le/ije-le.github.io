            In Nasarawa State, Nigeria, illegal miners are extracting lithium and selling it. The sales are often traced to Chinese companies, and are carried out without official regulation, depriving the Nigerian government of revenue and undermining a 2022 ban on unprocessed mineral exports. The report also documents the widespread use of child labour, with children as young as 9 or 10 working in dangerous mining conditions, highlighting weak regulatory enforcement and the risk the country may not fully benefit from its mineral resources.
