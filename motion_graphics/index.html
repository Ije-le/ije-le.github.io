      <!-- 5 PARAGRAPHS BEFORE VIDEO -->
       <h1>Background information and design process</h1>
      <p>This animation video was designed as an explainer for a previously published piece of journalism.</p>
      <p>The story, <i>How Abuja community paid nearly N10m to access good roads in three months</i>, showed how government neglect led residents of Kubwa, a community in the Bwari Area Council of Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory, to collectively fund the construction of their own roads, despite paying taxes.</p>
      <p>The aim of the video was to summarize the story, focusing on how a seemingly negligible sum of fifty naira, demanded by a group of women fixing potholes along Liberty Junction, snowballed into a significant amount paid by citizens as a result of government negligence.</p>
      <p>To begin the process, I first created a script for the video.</p>
      <p>Next, I created a storyboard in which I paired possible clips/images with different sections of the script.</p>
      <p>Since I was aiming for a fully animated video, I began the animation process by designing my assets. Most of the assets were hand-drawn in Photoshop and imported into AfterEffects for animation. While at this, I also generated the voice-over for the script on Adobe Premier Pro, which I imported into After Effects during animation.</p>
      <p>Some techniques I used repeatedly in putting the video together are position and expressions, and after the animation was done, I exported the video from AfterEffects, imported it to Premier Pro where I generated burned in captions.</p>
