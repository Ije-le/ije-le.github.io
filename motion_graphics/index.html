       <h1>Abuja residents pay nearly N10 million to access good roads in Kubwa</h1>
      <p>Residents of Kubwa, a community in the Bwari Area Council of Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory, spent about ten million naira to gain access to good roads between July and September 2023.</p>
      <p>This situation occurred after potholes at Liberty Junction grew wider after a prolonged period of government negligence, which prompted a group of women, Able Women, to take matters into their own hands.</p>
      <p>At first, they only asked passers-by for free will donations, but with time, they mounted roadblocks, targeting commercial motorcyclists because they were more easier to delay and less likely to run them over. The women forced them into paying fifty naira for tickets, and as the tension between the women and the motorcyclists grew, it often resulted in altercations that almost led to crashes in many cases.</p>
      <p>While fifty naira seems like a negligible sum, we estimated an average of 594 tickets sold per lane between 8.00am and noon, which translates to 148.5 tickets per hour on one lane, daily after observing on two occasions.</p>
      <p>When you multiply this average by fifty naira, the cost of one ticket, the women made about 22,000 naira from the three lanes every hour, which became 134,000 naira per day, 3.2 million naira in a month and 9.6 million naira in three months, a sum experts said was more than the cost of fixing the road that year with durable materials.</p>
