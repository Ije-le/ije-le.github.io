                    <h1>Giving life to historical documents</h1>
                        <p>Oftentimes investigative pieces, especially those that are historical or following a longer timeline, involve court cases.<br>Rules and regulations vary by state, but it’s fairly universal that obtaining court transcripts is an easier process than interviewing those involved. <strong>To be able to use this tool to take relevant quotes from a court transcript, or similar document, could bring a mundane story to life.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Let’s walk through one way to accomplish this.</strong></p>
                        <img src="https://ije-le.github.io/Group-AI-guide/unnamed.png" class="image">
                        <p>To test this, I found an example court transcript through Bloomberg Law. This is a recent case, so if it were the basis of a story it may be possible to speak with involved parties– but for the purpose of this exercise let’s pretend that we are unable to. <strong>I used a court docket:</strong> L.W. et al v. Skrmetti et al, Docket No. 3:23-cv-00376 (M.D. Tenn. Apr 20, 2023).</p>
                        <p><strong>Now, either sign in or create an ElevenLabs account.</strong> As mentioned in the section above, there is a free trial to use for testing purposes. If the tool proves itself useful, there is an option for paid subscription.</p>
                        <div>
                            <p>Let’s head to Studio.</p>
                            <img src="https://ije-le.github.io/Group-AI-guide/unnamed1.png" class="image">
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>We’re going to “start from scratch.” The back-and-forth of the transcript begins on page 4, so I copy and pasted about 2 pages worth of that into the text box.</strong></p>
                        <p>I had some various cleanups to do before we could start, such as deleting page numbers and fixing where spacing was odd from copy and pasting. Though, if this was a large issue, say for example if I was pasting in the entire transcript, I would go to another LLM and have them do it for me.</p>
                        <p>Now let’s head over to the right side of the screen, where we should see some voice options.</p>
                        <p>Many are hidden behind a paywall, but there are free options that I will use for the purposes of this exercise. <strong>We will want to “Override Settings,” and will use this to make our voices sound more human later.</strong></p>
                        <img src="https://ije-le.github.io/Group-AI-guide/unnamed2.png" class="image">
                        <p>In my example, and likely in your attempt as well if your transcript is like mine, the speaker names will be read out loud. Ignore this for now, we will remove them at the end. Until then, they serve us by keeping our speakers labelled.</p>
                        <p><strong>Now, we find our voices.</strong> For Mr. Block, I chose “Bill.” Now, I select all of Mr. Block’s lines and apply Bill’s voice to them.</p>
                        <img src="https://ije-le.github.io/Group-AI-guide/unnamed3.png" class="image">
                        <p>For The Court, I chose “Brian.” I did the same as before, selected all lines from the court and assigned Brian’s voice to them.</p>
                        <p>For Mr. Mortana I chose “Callum.”</p>
                        <p>And for Ms. Daniel I chose “Rachel.”</p>
                        <img src="https://ije-le.github.io/Group-AI-guide/unnamed4.png" class="image">
                        <p><strong>After everyone is given a voice, we can move forward to stylistic choices!</strong> Here is when I go to the “Override Settings” and play around with aspects like “Speed,” “Stability” and “Similarity” as I find it to be most human-sounding and pleasing to the ear.</p>
                        <p><strong>My advice? Make it faster.</strong> Humans talk quickly, especially lawyers. I also chose to lower the stability and lower the similarity to make it a bit less robotic.</p>
                        <p><strong>Now, our final step: Remove speaker names from the transcript.</strong> Now that everyone has their own voice, we no longer need the text to tell who is who.You can manually delete the names from the transcript within ElevenLabs. At this point, speakers show as different colors as you hover over the text anyways.</p>
                        <p><strong>Time to finalize! Listen to what you have for any glaring errors. You may click the "play" button to view my example below:</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Common errors include…</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Voices are too robotic? → Try playing around with the “override settings.” Options like “speed” and “stability” can be adjusted!
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Elevenlabs mispronouncing words or names? → Try writing in phonetic spelling or adjusting punctuation. For example, if it pronounces “read” as “red,” when you want it pronounced as “reed,” try spelling it like “reed,” instead.  
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>In the creation of most audio stories, interviews are recorded with quality equipment. This results in good audio that can be inserted right into the final audio story. But the procedure gets a bit more complicated with anonymous sources. Sure, in some situations the source may be willing to sit for a recorded interview and have their voice altered in post, but AI offers another option.</p>
                        <p>With AI, journalists can combine their audio story, and even the audio from their part of an interview, with an AI-generated voice for the anonymous source. With this solution, a nervous anonymous source may feel comforted to know that none of their actual audio is being published, with or without alterations in post.</p>
                        <p><strong>With <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/app/studio">ElevenLabs</a>, and a touch of audio editing experience, you can create the illusion of the interview audio with just the journalist’s spoken words and an AI-generated voice reading for the anonymous source from the transcript.</strong></p>
                        <p>If you don’t have much experience editing audio, Adobe has a guide linked <a heref="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/editing-audio-timeline-panel.html">here</a> to editing audio in the Premiere Pro timeline.</p>
                        <p>Much like the example above, head to ElevenLabs and create or log in to an account. A paid subscription is offered, but the free trial should be enough to test this method.</p>
                        <p>This tutorial will be similar to the previous one, with some easy adjustments.</p>
                        <p><strong>Let’s head to Studio.</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>We’re going to “start from scratch.”</strong> For the purposes of this example, the transcript is fake. The anonymous source is a woman, and her assigned voice will be “Rachel.” Select all text said by the anonymous source and assign it to “Rachel.”</p>
                        <img src="https://ije-le.github.io/Group-AI-guide/recent1.png" class="image">
                        <p>The process will look similar to this. Now, we make the empty audio where the reporter’s voice will be edited in. <strong>Delete lines said by the reporter, and replace them with “breaks.”</strong></p>
                        <img src="https://ije-le.github.io/Group-AI-guide/break.png" class="image">
                        <p><strong>The amount of breaks needed will depend on the length of what was said.</strong> Continue this process.</p>
                        <img src="https://ije-le.github.io/Group-AI-guide/recent2.png" class="image">
                        <p>Now, remove the name of any speakers, or in this case, “Source.” The finished product will be similar to the example below.</p>
                        <img src="https://ije-le.github.io/Group-AI-guide/recent3.png" class="image">
                        <p><strong>This audio is now ready to be downloaded and spliced with the original interview in an audio editor of your choice!</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Listen to this example below:</strong></p>
