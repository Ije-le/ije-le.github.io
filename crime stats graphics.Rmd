This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(treemapify)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(svglite)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
md_crime_stats <- read_csv("crimestatisticsmd.csv") 

#md_larceny<-md_crime_stats |>
 # group_by()


#md_crime_stats_long <- md_crime_stats %>%
 # pivot_longer(
   # cols = c("2012", "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019", "2020", "2021", "2022"),
   # names_to = "year",
   # values_to = "count"
  #)

area_chart<- ggplot(md_crime_stats_long, aes(x = year, y = Crimes, color = Crimes)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal()
print(area_chart)


#md_crime_stats_long %>%
  #ggplot(aes(x = Crimes, y = count, fill = year)) +
  #geom_col() +
  #theme_minimal() +
  #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  # Rotate crime labels
  #labs(title = "Crime Statistics by Year",
    #   x = "Type of Crime",
     #  y = "Number of Incidents",

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
